# Transformer Model Inference Experiments on Meluxina
## Overview

This repository contains a collection of scripts and files for running experiments on the inference of transformer pre-trained models. These experiments are designed to be executed on Meluxina, a high-performance computing (HPC) platform, utilizing one or multiple GPUs for optimal performance. The aim is to explore, benchmark, and refine the inference capabilities of transformer models in different configurations.
